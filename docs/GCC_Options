Most commonly used GCC options

	Warning options
		-Wall				:   Activate all warnings

	Debug Options
	   	-g					:   Produce debugging information in the OS native format

	Optimization Options
		-Os					:	Optimize for size, -Os enables all -O2 optimizations
		-ffunction-sections	:   Place each function into its own section in the output file, linker optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction space
		-fdata-sections     :   Place each data item into its own section in the output file, linker optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction space

	Machine dependant Options - ARM Options
		-mlittle-endian		:	Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode, this is the default for all standard configurations
		-march=name			:	Specifies the name of the target ARM architecture
		-mtune=name			:	Specifies the name of the target ARM processor for which GCC should tune the performance of the code
		-mcpu=name			:   Specifies the name of the target ARM processor
		-mfpu=name			:	This specifies the floating-point hardware is available on the target
		-mthumb      		:   Generates code that executes in Thumb state
		-mcpu=cortex-m4 	:   Cortex-M4 processor target

	Options Controlling the C dialect
		-std=name           :   Determine the language standard

	Preprocessor Options
		-D name             :   Predefine "name" as a macro, with definition 1
		-D name=definition	:   Predefine "name" as a macro, with definition "definition"
		-o file             :   Write output to "file"
		-I dir				:	Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for header files
		-include file		:	Process file as if #include "file" appeared as the first line of the primary source file

	Options for Linking
		-l library			:	Search the library named "library" when linking

	Options for directory search
		-L dir				: 	Add directory "dir" to the list of directories to be searched for "-l"
		-B prefix			:	This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler itself

GNU Linker options

		-Wl,option			:   Pass as "option" to the linker    
		-Wl,--gc-sections   :   Enable garbage collection of unused input sections, decides which input sections are used by examining symbols and relocatio
